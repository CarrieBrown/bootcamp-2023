    - Half day Thu or Fri
    
## Structure

- Mix of plenary sessions and content-specific tracks
- Some lecture style and some hands-on
- Meals/breaks near presentation sessions to facilitate interactions
- Blitz talks?
- Posters?

## Who

- Penn State presenters as much as possible
- Grads, postdocs, faculty, & staff
- Outside speakers if we can secure them and afford them
    - Consider high profile speakers to give "welcome" via Zoom

## Content

- Python and R; command line scripting/programming
- What is open science; why open science; how open science
- Variety of disciplines
    - Open science in...
        - psychology, anthropology, biology, etc., etc.
- Have specific program components related to what we learned from the survey [results](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/data-visualization.html).
    - e.g., where to share data
- Best practices/lessons learned.
    - e.g. video as data, documentation, demonstration
    - [PLAY Project](https://play-project.org)
    - 'Hyper-active' curation (Soska et al.)
- Take a look at prior R bootcamps ([2019](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp-2019); [2018](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp-2018); [2017](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp)) for ideas.
- Consider modules offered by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
- Session devoted to "Where does Open Science@PSU Go Next"

## Comms

- Create web book "proceedings"? Easy if we use `bookdown` or similar.
    - Nice if presenters can get a 'pub' from this.
